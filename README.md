üé¨ CineScope - A Movie Review & Rating Platform
I developed CineScope as a major project for an internship. The goal was to build a complete, full-stack web application using modern technologies like React and Firebase. I was inspired to create a clean, fast, and user-friendly alternative to existing movie sites, focusing on a great experience for discovering, saving, and reviewing movies.
